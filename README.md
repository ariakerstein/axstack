A - Action    → What YOU did (most of your answer)
R - Result    → Quantified outcomes (always include numbers)
l - Lessons   → What you learned (wrap it up)
```

### Story Selection Matrix

Map 6-8 stories to cover all competencies with backups:

| Story | Competencies | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Story A | Leadership, Influence | "Tell me about leading..." |
| Story B | Data, Prioritization | "How do you make decisions..." |
| Story C | Conflict, Growth | "Tell me about a failure..." |
| ... | ... | ... |
