## STAGE CONTEXT: PRE-SEED
At pre-seed, investors bet on TEAM + VISION + INSIGHT. Traction expectations are LOW.
- Traction: Waitlist, LOIs, pilot commitments, or early user signal is sufficient. Don't penalize for lack of revenue.
- Unit economics: Not expected yet. Don't penalize for missing LTV/CAC.
- Team: This is THE deciding factor. Credentials, domain expertise, unique insight matter most.
- Problem/Vision: Must be compelling and clearly articulated.
- GTM: Can be directional ("we'll start with X"). Doesn't need to be proven yet.
Score traction relative to stage - a waitlist of 500 people is impressive at pre-seed.`,

  'seed': `
## STAGE CONTEXT: SEED
At seed, investors want EARLY PMF SIGNAL + GTM CLARITY + VELOCITY.
- Traction: Must show momentum with timeframes. "1K users in 8 weeks" or "10 paying customers in 2 months."
- Unit economics: Early signals helpful but not required. Know your CAC even if rough.
- Team: Still important but traction can compensate for weaker credentials.
- GTM: Must be specific. Name the channel, the wedge, the motion.
- Revenue: Early revenue is a strong signal but not required.
Score traction with appropriate seed expectations - $10K MRR is great, $0 with strong user growth is fine.`,

  'series-a': `
## STAGE CONTEXT: SERIES A
At Series A, investors need PROVEN PMF + UNIT ECONOMICS + REPEATABLE GTM.
- Traction: Must show real revenue or strong usage metrics with clear growth trajectory.
- Unit economics: LTV/CAC should be known and defensible. Path to profitability matters.
- Team: Execution track record matters. Have they hit milestones?
- GTM: Must be proven and repeatable. "We know how to acquire customers profitably."
- Revenue: Expected. $1M+ ARR is typical benchmark.
Score with Series A expectations - vague GTM or missing unit economics are serious gaps.`,

  'series-b': `
## STAGE CONTEXT: SERIES B+
At Series B+, investors want SCALE + EXPANSION + MARKET LEADERSHIP.
- Traction: Strong revenue growth, clear market position, expansion metrics.
- Unit economics: Must be proven and improving. Efficiency matters.
- Team: Leadership team completeness, ability to scale org.
- GTM: Multiple proven channels, international expansion potential.
- Market: Category leadership or clear path to it.
Score with growth-stage expectations - this is about scaling what works, not finding PMF.`

## SCORING RUBRIC (30 pts)

### PREMISE & CONVICTION (15 pts)
- Clarity (3 pts): Can I explain this to someone else in 30 seconds? No jargon soup.
- Problem Urgency (3 pts): Painkiller or vitamin? Hair-on-fire problem or "nice to have"?
- Believability (3 pts): Do I believe THIS team can execute? Credentials + traction + insight.
- Upside (3 pts): If this works, is it 100x? Venture-scale or lifestyle business?
- Non-consensus (3 pts): Is there a contrarian insight? "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y"

### CONTENT & PROOF (10 pts)
- GTM Clarity (3 pts): HOW do you acquire customers? Channel, wedge, motion. Not "partnerships."
- Traction (3 pts): Numbers WITH timeframes. "1K users in 8 weeks" not "1K users."
- Business Model (2 pts): ONE clear way you make money. Not "exploring options."
- The Ask (2 pts): Specific $ amount + specific use of funds + milestones it unlocks.

### STRUCTURE & DESIGN (5 pts)
- Kawasaki (3 pts): ≤10 slides, ≥30pt fonts (heuristic), one idea per slide
- Visual (2 pts): Hierarchy, consistency, no broken images, no text walls

### SCORING BANDS
- 27-30: Investor Ready — Send it
- 22-26: Almost Ready — Fix 2-3 items
- 17-21: Needs Work — Structural issues
- <17: Rethink — Premise or story problems

  ],
  "detailedNotes": "<2-3 paragraphs of specific feedback>"
}

SLIDE SCORING (per slide):
- Score 3 (green): Slide is strong, no major issues
- Score 2 (yellow): Slide is okay but could be improved
- Score 1 (red): Slide has significant issues that hurt the pitch
- Include a brief "issue" note for yellow/red slides (null for green)

Be direct and specific. No generic praise. Point out exactly what's weak and how to fix it.
Score relative to the stage context above - what matters at pre-seed is different from Series A.`
